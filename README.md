# TW Farm Assistant

Tribalwars Farm Assistant is an extension that provides a free, easy-to-use and configurable alternative to the in-game Farm Assistant.

## Instructions

### How to install it?
The easiest way to install it is from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tw-farm-assistant/pdfmicofbncclmklndnedcgedogelgoa).

As TW Farm Assistant is a personal open-source project you are free to modify it/make your contributions and run it from the Google Chrome's Extension Page by enabling the developer mode.

### How to use it?

#### Step 1

When you first install the extension you won't have any villages or units models configured and by clicking you may see this:

![Empty popup](./imgs/empty_popup.png)

To add a new village and/or units model click in "Configure farm" button.

#### Step 2
This configuration page is very intuitive and similar to the tribalwars style. In the first table you can add or remove villages and in the second one you can add or remove units models.

![Options page](./imgs/options.png)

The page has also a **Save** button but all the changes are stored as they are performed so you don't need to worry!

#### Step 3
Now that you have all setup and running your extension popup may look similar to this.

To start farming **MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ONLY ONE TAB OF THE GAME OPEN** and click the model you want to use. Now you may see your attack been placed in the next seconds *et voil√°!* 

## FAQ's

### Will I get banned for using this extension?
You may use this extension by your own risk but nobody has been banned for using it. The tool is simply a "click automation" and 0% intrusive.

### Does this extension works in all worlds and all countries?
Yes, the tool was designed and built to run in every world of every country.

### How many units models/templates can I store?
Unlike the in-game assistant that only allows you to store 2 models, this extension allows you to store unlimited number of models.

### Does this tool replace the in-game farm assistant?
No, some of the aspects different from the in-game assistant that you need to be aware are:
- Villages coordinates need to be added manually.
- Because the coordinates are manually inserted you **must keep an eye** on the reports you get to make sure that the village stills abandoned and that you are not losing unnecessary troops.
- There isn't any visual sign when the attack command is placed (besides the page reload) so you have to make sure you only click once or you you will end up placing multiple attacks to the same village.
- The extension doesn't take into consideration if you have sufficient units to place the attack, although if you don't the attack won't be placed.

As a lover of Tribalwars I developed and shared this tool with the only intent of providing a free farm alternative to all the game lovers.
